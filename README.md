# diablo_clone
The world of Arueth used to be one of magic, heroes, and gods but it is the dawning of a new age. The new discovery of Abberant Sulfur has lead to the common man having the same luxuries as any Magi. Travel has been reduced to a fraction of the time due to crystal lanes being constructed, reducing the time for a hundred mile journey from five days to just hours. New devices and machines once hidden away from the world by dwarves and gnomes have become mundane. It is in these trying times that the world seems to be shrinking. The identity of each nation and each race is being lost as the intermingling of societies heightens tensions. Conflict is constant and equality is a finite resource held in the iron grip of the dragonkin and their expanding empire.

This game is a diablo clone. It may have elements of random generation or it may be tailor made. We have no clue.

Current Focus:

Getting the map to work. Probably going to use Tiled and either make our own parser or steal one (legally of course).

Get the camera working.

Work on player input methods. Keyboard Movement // Classic Diablo clicking movement // RTS/MOBA Movement

Have the player able to attack and do other abilities.

Netcode?!?! Who freakin' knows!


Implemented:

Uhhh... basic keyboard movement and collision

Dummy animations (automatic every 8 frames, like NES Dragon Quest).
