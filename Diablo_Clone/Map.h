 Let me break this down, yo.
 You make the map in Tiled, export the "data":  [x,y,z] thingy. Then you change it to an array in C and we hard-code it.
 I do this because I dunno how to parse anything. Someone will need to make a parser.
 
 We'll fix this dumb shit later. Let's just get the functionality there before worrying about creation.
 
 The exported data is always incremented by 1 from his editor version. So I compensate for that.
 USE THE EDITOR ID, NOT THE FREAKIN' DATA ONE!
